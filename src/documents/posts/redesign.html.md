I'm working on an (admittedly simple) redesign of my site. I may
change things significantly from this form because

1. I am indecisive, and
2. This is fun.

One obvious difference is that there is a section here for "posts."
I'm not sure exactly what's going to become of this section. I might
end up scrapping it in the future. But for now, it's here. I have a
soft spot for blogging. When I first purchased this domain when I was
in 7th grade, I wrote a blog that was horribly written and often
banal, but my friends kept reading, so I kept writing.

As a graduate student, I probably have more interesting things to say
now than I did back then. Probably.
